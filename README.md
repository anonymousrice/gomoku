# gomoku
A java implementation of Gomoku (Connect Five) with non-AI algorithm.<p>
This algorithm is based on a mechanism that checks scoring before each step and optimizes the scoring difference between computer and human player. However, the algorithm still needs to improve when multiple potential threats occur at the same time.
